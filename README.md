# WiemanTheme

WiemanTheme is a custom theme designed for BetterDiscord.

Initially made for personal use, I decided to make it available to the public for anyone to download if they wish.

If you're interested you can [download the theme file](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/wiemanboy/WiemanTheme/blob/master/wiemantheme.theme.css).

Overall, the WiemanTheme offers a stylish and functional option for those looking to add a personal touch to their Discord experience. If you're interested, feel free to check it out and give it a try!
