WiemanTheme is a custom theme designed for BetterDiscord.

Initially made for personal use, I decided to make it available to the public for anyone to download if they wish.

## Notable Features

-   A custom color scheme that is easy on the eyes, featuring a nice purple color.
-   Some readjustment of UI elements to eliminate clutter and make the UI more compact.

-   A collapsible server list to make better use of space.
